This is an attempt to get a reduced soap4r to work on ruby 1.9 for my specific purposes.
The main support excluded so far is the date formatting
The date format has been hardcoded so that this :

Time.parse(DateTime.now.to_s).to_datetime.to_s 

will always produces the expected result. 



Otherwise, the goal is to have it pass all the unit tests. 


This is a work in progress, and not tested at all in anything close to a production environment. 

Also - as a caveat - I am a SOAP noob,the hope is that is the unit tests pass on 1.9, then there is a reasonable chance this library can be used in the same way soap4r is used for 1.8 projects.
